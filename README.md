# Stanford-CS-193p-Emoji-Art

This repository is my work in progress on assignment 4 «Emoji-ART» at Stanford University's course CS193p. Lectures are available for everyone at https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/

Required Tasks

- [x] Support the selection of one or more of the emojis which have been dragged into your EmojiArt document (i.e. you’re selecting the emojis in the document, not the ones in the palette at the top). You can show which emojis are selected in any way you’d like. The selection is not persistent (in other words, restarting your app will not preserve the selection).
- [x] Tapping on an unselected emoji should select it.
- [x] Tapping on a selected emoji should unselect it.
- [x] Single-tapping on the background of your EmojiArt (i.e. single-tapping anywhere except on an emoji) should deselect all emoji.
- [x] Dragging a selected emoji should move the entire selection to follow the user’s finger.
- [x] If the user makes a dragging gesture when there is no selection, pan the entire document.
- [x] If the user makes a pinching gesture anywhere in the EmojiArt document and there is a selection, all of the emojis in the selection should be scaled by the amount of the pinch.
- [x] If there is no selection at the time of a pinch, the entire document should be scaled.
- [x] Make it possible to delete emojis from the EmojiArt document. This Required Task is intentionally not saying what user-interface actions should cause this. Be creative and try to find a way to delete the emojis that feels comfortable and intuitive.
